# Acronym Generator (a.k.a "AcryGen")

This is a super basic acronym generator. It simply pulls words that start with the appropriate letters from a list of ~over 400k~ about 20k words and slaps 'em together. Additionally, swear words can now be filtered out of the acronyms and a single acronym will not contain duplicate words.

I'm still working to refine the word list to filter out acronyms (ironic huh) and be a little more expansive, while still avoiding the non-sensical and extremely long words that plagued the initial word list. I would also like to add a little NLP to help create acronyms that are structured in a more correct way.

The current version of this generator can be found at [acrygen.herokuap.com](https://acrygen.herokuapp.com)
