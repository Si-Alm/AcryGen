# Acronym Generator (a.k.a "AcryGen")

This is a super basic acronym generator. It simply pulls words that start with the appropriate letters from a list of over 400k words and slaps 'em together

Currently, I'm working to refine the list to avoid the nonsenical words that are currently showing up. Additionally, a better method for creating acronyms is being looked into, because they're bad right now - like real bad.

The current version of this generator can be found at [acrygen.herokuap.com](https://acrygen.herokuapp.com)
